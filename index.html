          <h6>Dear Founders and Coders team!
            <br>I am indeed fresher to coding. This is the first website I have ever created.
  <br> I still can’t believe that couple of weeks ago I even did not know what was "closing tag"
  <br> and now I am adding this fancy animations and it shows as auto typing! WOW! Sorry for my excitement,
  <br> I feel so happy that I achieved this by myself and by self-learning. Your requirenments pushed me to come to this level. Thank you!</h6>

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>It took me 28 years to make a big decision to pursue my passion. For some people programming is just a profession, for some it is just a work, but for me it is a big dream. I am a woman originally from Azerbaijan who wants to make her dream of being software engineer to come true. I am a finance professional and has worked in this profession several years, however I always wanted to have an IT career. In my home country, it is exceptionally difficult for a woman to be a developer. Because not only companies, but also universities prefer to recruit males for IT field. Additionally, my family is on low income and money was always a barrier for me. I had no choice other than to choose studying finance as it was the only specialisation for which I could get both admission and full scholarship to do my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and a job at the end. Due to the economic crisis in Azerbaijan originated from the oil price clash, the company I worked was closed, and I lost my job. It was very difficult to find a new job in the finance field during the crisis. Unexpectedly, my husband got a job offer from one of the UK firm and we moved to London. My job search in London was taught considering that I was immigrant and then it overlapped with COVID-19 which made it very difficult to get a finance job.  It was at this time that my husband pointed me something very important. He reminded me that the part I enjoyed most about my job was not actually in my job description. The thing that got me excited everyday in my last job was not financial related at all. It was the opportunity to code up new solutions (mainly with excel formulas) to problems I had encountered. He reminded me that I had often talked about making the leap into a software development, but it was difficult in my home country and I was also too scared of the loss of income that would happen while transitioning to a new career. He told me that it is not a roadblock anymore and I should just go for it. I started to take a full stack web development course by Dr Angela Yu on Udemy. She inspires me as she accomplished her dream of being a web developer. By profession she was an NHS doctor but had transitioned to a software development.
          <br>
          <br>
           Later I was searching for anything related to coding in London and came across with Founders and Coders. I am thrilled by the opportunity Founders and Coders provides for people who want to be a software engineer, especially for the ones who has no knowledge or experience in coding. I have the most grounded inspiration to progress in this field and bring new insights to this field. I do believe that the bootcamp by Founders and Coders will be the key to open the door of my software engineer career. Apart from my professional experience, I also got a chance to be an adjunct lecturer at the university. I really enjoy teaching as this allows me to pass all my knowledge and skills to other people and help them to accomplish their goals. In light of this, I have the strongest motivation to stay as a mentor after the completion of the bootcamp to pass my knowledge and skills to the students who want to pursue their passion.</p>

          <p>I have worked at Procter & Gamble Azerbaijan, Yapikredi Bank, Deloitte Azerbaijan in different years of my life as a financial and business analyst. My experience in industry plays significant role in development of my interpersonal and relationship-building skills. I have developed team building, leadership, communication and analytical skills.
    <br>
      <br>
          I also had a chance of working for Higher Education Institutions (Open University and Azerbaijan State University of Economics), where the majority part of my teaching work was associated with different environments and settings and I managed to significantly develop my transferable skills.

            <p>My hobbies include <strong>photography, blogging, cooking and pilates</strong>. Yes, I am very social person and love to go (before the pandemic) to Pilates to meet new people, to improve my social life and of course for the purpose of being fit.
             <br>
             Due to my love to photography and discovering new cultures, I started to blog about London life on Instagram three years ago, and today I have 10k organic followers. I enjoy to engage with different people, share my experience with the sake of being useful to someone.
